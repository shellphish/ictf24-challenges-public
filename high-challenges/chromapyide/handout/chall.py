Welcome to the Python Guide book! Powered by ChromaDB
This program has a list of basic python functions and their explanations.
You can access the functions by providing what you want to do
Example usage is as follows:
Now what would you like to do ?
1. Query for a function
2. Exit
1
Please enter the function you would like to query
add
We were able to find 2 results
Result 1:
Name of the function: add
Explanation: The `add(a, b)` function takes two numbers (`a` and `b`) and adds them together. Itâ€™s like combining two values to get their total. If you call `add(3, 5)`, it will give you `8`.
Result 2:
Name of the function: sum_of_cubes
Explanation: The `sum_of_cubes(n)` function calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. For example, `sum_of_cubes(3)` will return `1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 36`.
Would you like to see the body of a function ?
1. Yes
2. No

def add(a, b):
    return a + b


def sum_of_cubes(n):
    return sum(i**3 for i in range(1, n+1))
