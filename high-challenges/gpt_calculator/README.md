# GPT Calculator
You stumble upon a unique calculator interface, powered by ChatGPT and supercharged with a Python executor. On the surface, it’s an incredibly advanced tool for complex calculations—type in any math problem, and it responds with precision and accuracy. With the help of ChatGPT, it even understands natural language commands, making interactions feel almost human.

But there’s something… unusual about this calculator. Rumor has it that beneath the friendly exterior lies a hidden file, flag.txt, containing a secret message. But don’t expect it to reveal its secrets so easily.

Can you navigate its capabilities and uncover the hidden flag.txt?
