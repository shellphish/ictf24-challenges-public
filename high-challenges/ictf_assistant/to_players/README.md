# iCTF Assistant

Hey there! We created an LLM-powered assistant to answer questions from the players. Unfortunately, we accidentally left a secret string (i.e., the flag) in the knowledge bank provided to the LLM. To address this potential security risk, we have instructed the LLM not to leak any information about the flag.

In this challenge, you will need to attempt to jailbreak the system instructions and retrieve the flag.

Please refer to the source code files to understand how the assistant is set up. Also, please test your solution locally (using your own OpenAI API key) first. Once you manage to obtain the fake flag locally, you can then proceed to contact the iCTF server to retrieve the real flag.

Happy jailbreaking!
