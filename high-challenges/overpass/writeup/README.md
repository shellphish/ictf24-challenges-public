The intended solution requires you to extract some information from the text: 

1. You are on top of a building that is 35.9m high. --> 35.9m 
2. You are in the United States of America --> United States
3. There is a monument nearby (within 100m) --> Monument in radius 100m

Now as you might have guessed, googled, already known or seen from the challenge description, you are supposed to use the Overpass Query Language. 

- API can be found here: https://overpass-turbo.eu
- An online version for usage here: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide#Overpass_QL_Basics


Using these sources (and maybe some help of an LLM if you feel lazy), you can write a query to find the respective buildings. 

The final query looks something like this: 

```
// Set area
area[name="United States"]->.a;
// Get all historic monuments in the US
node(area.a)["historic"="monument"]->.b;
// Find buildings that have height 35.9
nwr(around.b:100)["height"="35.9"]->.c;
nwr(around.c:10000)["aeroway"="runway"];
/*added by auto repair*/
(._;>;);
/*end of auto repair*/
out body;
```

1. You start with finding the area *name="United States"*.<br>
2. Then you can sort for monuments in said area. After that you look for buildings that are in range of these monuments and filter for all the ones that have the exact height "35.9m". 
3. You can further find "nearby" runways. For this just arbitrarily set a radius to look in. Start small and increase size. Soon enough you will hit an airport. 

This `(._;>;);` is "fixing" the overpass tool adds for you, if you choose to write the query like I did.

Notes: 

1. If you chose to let an LLM write this query. It will look very different and might be much more of a pain to debug.  
2. There are some quirks to the OverpassEU interface, also sometimes it does not show the results for the queries (I don't know why)
3. It might be possible to solve this challenge without using overpass. That being said, I am quite confident that this is a very painful process.
