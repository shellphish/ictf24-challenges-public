description: "Your computer has been acting weirdly lately and you suspect that some malicious actors are targetting your system. You therefore decided to run a network capture to see what type of traffic is hitting your machine. We did some preliminary filtering of the traffic and suspect indeed some malicious traffic hitting your system. Can you identify the malicious packets to obtain the flag?"


Hints:
- Try using tools like Wireshark to take an initial look at the traffic
- Use python to read in the pcap file an extract features.
- Perhaps you can do some anomaly detection on the traffic to discover interesting patterns?
