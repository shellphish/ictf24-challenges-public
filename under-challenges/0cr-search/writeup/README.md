There are many possible solutions, both in the video channel and the audio channel.  The naive (expected, but less innovative) solution is a direct extract by VSE.

1) Set up VSE on the system (preferably with GPU).
2) Open the movie file within VSE.
3) Extract subtitles
4) Open the SRT within a text editor
5) Ctrl-F search for the word "flag"
6) Find the flag sentence and enter it


Additional innovations:
1) Use an audio transcriber to achieve the same goal, or combine it with the OCR approach to shorten search time
2) Reduce video framerate to 12 fps (or higher, or lower) in order to reduce OCR search time.
