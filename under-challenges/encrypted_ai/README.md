# Encrypted AI

## Challenge Overview

A student has designed a PyTorch model and embedded a hidden flag within it. To add a layer of security, he encrypted the model using XOR encryption with a random 16-byte key before sharing it with his friends. However, the student forgot to save both the encryption key and the unencrypted model, making the task of revealing the hidden flag a puzzle.

Your challenge is to recover the encryption key and decrypt the model to unveil the concealed information. The encrypted model file is provided i.e., `model_encrypted.pth`.

Good luck, and happy decrypting!
