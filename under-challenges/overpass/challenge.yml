description: "Flip phone beeps.\n\n.. .. ..\n.. .. ..\n.. .. ..\n\nHey (insert CTF players name)!\n\ndamn, yesterday was rough… remember that me and a couple of friends went out for partying?\nApparently, the combination of non-alcoholic beverages, good vibes and burgers made me lose control… seems like I got on a plane and went some place in the United States.\nNow that I have recovered from my party induced coma, I have absolutely no clue where I am.\n\nAll I know is that I can see a something high, maybe a monument? I would say it's within around 100m of the building's roof I woke up on.\nMy watch tells me that the building is 35.9 meters high. Now listen, I'm kinda lost and I need to get to this thing tomorrow. Can you help me figure out where I am?\n\nAlso, can you find the nearest airport that only has two runways?\n\nFlag format: The name of the building I am on, followed by the name of the monument nearby and the IATA code of the airport. All lower case, replace spaces with '_'\n\nictf{first_building_the_thing_airportcode}"
